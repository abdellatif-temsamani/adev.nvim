# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! However, please
note that **pull requests are rarely accepted**.

## Pull Request Policy

This project is primarily maintained by the original author. While we appreciate
contributions and feedback, **pull requests are rarely merged**. This is by
design to maintain consistency and control over the codebase.

### What This Means

- **Pull requests may be closed without merging** - This is normal and expected
- **Issues are welcome** - Bug reports, feature requests, and discussions are
  encouraged
- **Fork and modify freely** - You're welcome to fork this project and make your
  own modifications
- **Respect the license** - Any modifications must comply with the project's
  license terms

### Branch Policy

**All pull requests must be submitted against the `nightly` branch.**

- Do not submit PRs against `main` or `master`
- The `nightly` branch is where experimental changes are considered
- This helps maintain stability of the main branch

## Before Contributing

If you're considering contributing, please:

1. **Check existing issues** - Your idea might already be discussed
2. **Open an issue first** - Discuss your proposed changes before submitting a
   PR
3. **Keep it simple** - Small, focused changes are more likely to be considered
4. **Follow the code style** - Match the existing formatting and conventions
5. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality

## Alternative Ways to Contribute

Even if pull requests aren't typically accepted, you can still contribute by:

- **Reporting bugs** - Help identify and document issues
- **Suggesting features** - Share ideas for improvements
- **Improving documentation** - Suggest clarifications or additions
